To build the docs, install the optional group `docs` with `pip`, and then run
`make html`.

That should create a version identical to the one from ReadTheDocs, which can
be used to preview changes. The files will be stored in `build/html`.

There may be warnings in the build output, but these are legacy and will be
addressed later.
